### Usage

MATLAB files with **run** as prefix are driver script that depend on other functions to 
perform certain computation. MATLAB files with **func** as prefix are functions and can be called from MATLAB script or command line. Check if it has global variables (not the best practice, so I use it sparingly) and define accordingly.
